# sippiez_client

Each webpage has an html file and corresponding javascript file. The javascript files contain GET and
POST requests to our webservice to retrieve/post data to/from our database. It then uses that data
to create HTML elements that are displayed to the user.

The app can be run by opening one of the html files on a browser or visiting the live website at:
